You: Hi I am Sagnnik
AI: Hello Sagnnik! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with, or would you like to chat?

You: Hey who am I?
AI: I don't actually know who you are, as we just started our conversation and I didn't have any information about you prior to that. You mentioned your name earlier (Sagnnik), but I don't have any context or background info on you. Would you like to tell me a bit more about yourself?

You: I am from India from a state called West Bengal
AI: West Bengal is a beautiful state in Eastern India, known for its rich cultural heritage and diverse geography. It's also famous for its delicious cuisine, vibrant festivals, and stunning natural beauty.

Where are you living in West Bengal now? Are you still based in the same city where you grew up, or have you moved to a different part of the state?

(By the way, I'm curious - what's your favorite thing about West Bengal?)

You: I live in Kolkata and I am 23 years old
AI: Kolkata is one of the most vibrant cities in India, with a rich history and culture that's still very much alive. It's great to hear that you call it home!

As a 23-year-old Kolkatian, you must be surrounded by the city's fast-paced energy and diverse cultural influences. From the street food to the music, art, and literature, Kolkata has so much to offer.

What do you like to do in your free time? Are you into any particular hobbies or activities that help you unwind?

(Also, I'm curious - have you tried any of the famous Bengali dishes, such as jhol or bhapa ilish?)

You: I have tried bhapa ilish
AI: Bhapa ilish is a classic Bengali dish! It's a delicate and flavorful way to prepare hilsa fish, one of Bengal's iconic catches. The steaming process helps preserve the fish's moisture and flavor, resulting in a tender and delicious meal.

If you like bhapa ilish, you might also want to try some other traditional Bengali dishes like jhol bhaat (spicy rice with fish), mishti doi (sweet yogurt), or shorshe ilish (mustard-based hilsa curry).

Kolkata has an incredible culinary scene, and there's always something new to try. Have you ever visited any of the famous eateries or food stalls in the city?

(By the way, have you traveled much outside of India? What's your favorite travel experience so far?)

You: Hey can you give me my biodata in compact form?
AI: Based on our conversation, here is a condensed version of your biodata:

**Name:** Sagnnik
**Age:** 23
**Nationality:** Indian
